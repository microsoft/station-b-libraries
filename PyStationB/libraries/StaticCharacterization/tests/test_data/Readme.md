The following examples are representatives of different OD curve shapes:
  - `S-shape`, here we see the fully-developed S-shaped curve in OD. These are our perfect (or close to perfect) examples.
  - `SignificantDeath`, in `S-shape` samples usually there is a small drop. In this directory the drop (the death phase) looks very large.
  - `NotFullyDeveloped`, here we see bacteria growing very slowly, so that the whole S-shape is not visible.
  - `TotallyFlat`, seems that there is no growth at all. (It's like `NotFullyDeveloped`, but *a lot* slower).


Note: 
  - These classes are not very precisely defined.
  - There may be more sensible classes.
  - These class definitions were based entirely on the shape of the OD signal.
