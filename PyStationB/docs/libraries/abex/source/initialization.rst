Initialization

.. warning::

    This functionality does not work with categorical inputs yet.
    It should be used only when there are only continuous inputs involved.

Suppose we have not collected any observations yet. It is possible that there are areas in the parameter space that look
more promising than others for an experienced eye, but assume that we do not have the access to expert knowledge.

One strategy is to sample the space in quite a uniform way. We built a wrapper over Emukit's functionalities for this.
