Emukit (external)
=================

We depend on the `emukit <https://github.com/Emukit/emukit>`_ library for experimental design methods, 
particularly Bayesian optimisation.
It is included here as a library because we contribute to its development, 
and therefore incorporate into PyStationB as a git submodule.
